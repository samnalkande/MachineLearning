# MachineLearning
this repository is about Linear Regression and classification example in Python Sklearn .

Linear Regression fits a line on all if we are taking only one independent
variable and if we take multiple independent variables then it will give us
a plane or do an approximation to complete equation 

And example of K Nearest Neighbor Classification In Python of iris.
The dataset is included in R base and Python in the machine learning package Scikit-learn,
so that users can access it without having to find a source for it.
